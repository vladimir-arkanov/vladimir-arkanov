# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Volodymyr Arkanov and I'm a software developer. I'm passionate about building web applications and have experience working with the following technologies:

</p>

I've been studying these tools for almost a year now and I recently started a full-time education program in MA. Through this program, I've gained valuable experience working closely with mentors, receiving code reviews, and completing tasks that simulate small components used in real commercial projects.

In addition to this, I've also completed three personal projects that I'm particularly proud of:

- An HTML page

- A pet project completed with a small team, which can be used as a component in a real commercial project

I'm excited to continue growing my skills and collaborating with other developers. Feel free to check out my Github profile and get in touch with me!
